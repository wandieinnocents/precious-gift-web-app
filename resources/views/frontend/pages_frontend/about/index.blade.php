                        </div>
                        <div class="lower-text">Our organization is Located in the hills of Mityana District of Uganda is Mboona Village which
                            serves as a hub to all all the 7 (Seven) villages which make kibale parish in bulera subcounty.

                            The village has got one water source which is also accessed by the other surrounding villages. A
                            primary school which gives foundation to all the rest of the villages is also in Mboona Village.
                            To add on that is a small health center with a capacity of admitting one patient at time which
                            according to the community was donated by the area member of parliament which too serves the
                            rest of the communities around.

                            Just to note, at the time when we visited Mboona Village we found the health center closed
                            simply because the two nurses had also been sick and one admitted. This tells you the condition
                            of the community. Imagine what happens to the patients if the doctors too are admitted and no
                            one is left to attend to the patients? The answer is yours to think about.

                            In a summary, if Mboona catches a cough then the rest of the other community stands chance of
                            contamination simply because it serves as a hub. We are saying letâ€™s give a ray of hope to these
                            seven villages by uplifting the standards of Mboona Village.</div>
